**Artistic Motivations**
I wrote this piece “Take a Chance with Me” about the journey from childhood and adulthood, and how growing up can be daunting. I went for an 80’s pop feel and used the theme of outer space and the universe as it seemed fitting with the song's message. There are multiple sounds used, in which I obtained the Sizzling/Cooking noise and the Pilot Announcement from Freesound.com. I chose a sizzling/cooking noise because it reminded me of how my mom would make food for me before I go somewhere, and the Pilot Announcement was for my upcoming “trip” that I had to leave for. The voicemail at the end is one from my mom and I used her voicemail as she always checked up on me when I got to my destination. In this song, my destination is unknown, but it was time for me to leave the nest as much as I wanted to have my mom with me.  

**Instruments Used**
I used my vocals as the main instrument and recorded using an SM-58 mic. I used Flex Pitch for some notes sung in the Main Vocals that were a bit off. I used Space Designer for the voice effects; mainly using spring and plate reverbs. I used Channel EQ on the main vocals to change the shape of the sound. I also used DeEsser 2 because I noticed that a lot of my lyrics contain plosives. As for the techniques used, I used MIDI, panning, and synthesizer.  

**Techniques Used**
- **MIDI:** I obtained the following MIDI loops from the Apple Loops library: 80s Back Beat 01, 80s Back Beat 02, 80s Ballad Chords 01, 80s Ballad Chords 02, 80s Ballad Chords 03. I deconstructed and took away some notes form the Ballad Chords loops to add variety to the song while staying in key. I played the following MIDI software instruments: Thumb Bass, Trumpet, Studio Cellos. I tried my best to humanize the Studio Cellos. 

- **Panning:** I tried my best to create space by panning the appropriate instruments and keeping the main vocals in the center.
