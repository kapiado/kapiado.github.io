**Abstract**

This experiment was conducted with the purpose of identifying the potato chip brands with the highest and lowest chip-to-air ratio. Four of the most popular brands of potato chips packaged in plastic bags were studied: Layâ€™s, Ruffles, Kettle and Cape Cod. The null hypothesis states that the chip density mean of each brand is equal to one another. There were 4 levels of potato chip brands and a sample size of 5 for each bag, resulting in 20 experimental runs being performed. The null hypothesis was ultimately rejected and there was enough evidence to conclude that there was at least one brand of chips whose chip density is different from the other brands. This experiment was conducted using one-way ANOVA to conclude the main results of this experiment. These findings are significant since it shows the packaging of different potato chip brands are significantly different from each other. Finding the average chip density of each chip brand is useful in everyday life so the average consumer can be informed of which bags of chips are over-inflated and can be better informed when purchasing their favorite snack.
