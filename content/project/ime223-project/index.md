Course: [IME 223: Process Improvement Fundamentals](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/coursesaz/ime/#:~:text=IME%C2%A0223.%20Process%20Improvement%20Fundamentals) *(Fall 2020)*

**About**

The process analyzed was preparing and cooking a pizza from scratch. All of the team
members followed the same recipe to prevent errors in time readings. By using
the same recipe, we had the same waiting times for the dough rising and pizza baking. The
only times that differed for each team member was the preparation time. We bought our own ingredients and made sure to use the right measurements according to the recipe.

**Goal**

Our goal was to solve the preparation and waiting times while making a pizza. At a glance, we
can see that it takes time to prepare and bake the pizza. Since everything was made from scratch (assuming that nothing was premade or pre-cut), there was a high chance that the
preparation time will take longer than the baking time. We cut our toppings since we
bought them whole. The number of toppings desired determined how long the
preparation time will be. We made the pizza dough and waited for the dough to rise. These waiting times could not be changed to ensure that the dough has fully risen and the pizza has cooked thoroughly.

**Solution Design**

The process we studied involves all of the tasks that must be completed for the team to
finish cooking a decent pizza. After collecting data regarding the volume, process flow, cycle
time, availability, layouts, and ergonomics, we compiled the data and organized it. We created a flow diagram showing a basic kitchen layout, conduct a data time study, a motion
study, and analyze productivity. Ideally, we found the most inefficient process and provided a solution that will increase the cycle time for each team member to cook their pizza.

**Approach**

In order for our process to be more efficient, the bottleneck of the operation needs to be removed,
which can be found in the preparation steps. The approach for completing the project was cooking the pizza in our own homes and recording time trials. We had to buy the ingredients from our local grocery market while practicing safety measures due to COVID-19. Since the project was completed from our own homes, we cooked around those who lived with us, so practicing safe measures due to COVID-19 may not be necessary. These measures included social distancing and wearing face masks.
