Course: [IME 156: Basic Electronics Manufacturing](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/coursesaz/ime/#:~:text=IME%C2%A0156.%20Basic%20Electronics%20Manufacturing) *(Spring 2020)*

**About**

This project was about building a Prism LED project, which included:
- Developing a PCB layout design using Autodesk EAGLE software
- Uploading code to Arduino with Arduino IDE software
- Soldering through-hole and surface mount components to a PCB and wiring to terminals
- Manufacturing a custom chassis to house the electronics project assembly
- Performing electrical testing using a multi-meter
- Re-working and troubleshooting operations on a working electronic project

The kit for this project was provided by Cal Poly in order to build a Prism: an exciting interactive light show experience using an Arduino-type microcontroller and custom circuitry.

This was the first quarter affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted students to leave campus and reside at home, so this project was done at home. Although the task of soldering seemed daunting at first, my father has had soldering experience and helped me through the process. I have to say that I highly enjoyed soldering!

**Approach**

[Custom Chassis](custom-chassis-collage.png)

For the chassis box, my father helped me build a wooden box with wood planks found in my backyard. My father had a compound miter saw to cut the wood planks and a drill bit with attachments of various sizes to cut holes into the wood. There was a lot of trial and error at first because we wanted to make sure the holes had the correct diameter and precise placement. I'm proud of the fact that we didn't waste material and I had a lot of fun working on this project!
