**Artistic Motivations**

I wrote the song “Thank You for Your Love” about a past heartbreak and recent gratitude for the experiences shared with my ex-partner. I remember I was trying so hard to hold on to someone because I didn’t want to be alone. As time went by, it was all a process of letting go and being able to finally do so; the art of letting go is the song from start to finish. The lyrics are very expressive in this sense.

**Instruments & Techniques Used**

The main instrument used was vocals provided by myself. Since the main instrument was my vocals, I layered the accompaniment with vocal harmonies and adlibs. I recorded my voice using the Shure SM58 microphone. Throughout the song, I utilized three loops provided by Apple Loops in Logic Pro: Around the Block Snare, Now And Always Electric Piano, and Assembly Line Beat. Flex pitch was used on the melody vocals to fix notes sung that were sharp. In Space Designer from Audio FX, Choir Hall (01.3s) within Large Spaces was used for all vocal tracks, differentiating the length for each vocal track. The intro and outro vocals had their length a bit longer. Fade in and fade out were utilized on the harmonies and on one of the loops.
