**About**

The analysis performed shows how employees' mental health in the workplace correlates with how employers view mental health. These are the following questions addressed:

- How does mental health affect work? 
- How important is mental health? 
- What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes toward mental health in the workplace? 

**Data**

The data collected is from the following dataset ["Mental Health in Tech Survey" (2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) from Kaggle.
